mlrVST
======

VST port of the popular monome app using JUCE. At this stage, the app is very much in the experimental phase, so probably of very little interest to anyone. 

Current Status
--------------

UI is starting to take shape (at least in terms of functionality).
No audio at all.


Ideas / Upcoming Features
-------------------------
- ADSR envelopes for samples (maybe make advanced options).
- configurable number of channels
- loop current block only on hold down button
- Load MIDI tracks into stips
- Speed independent pitch control of samples
