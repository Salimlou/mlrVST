mlrVST
======

VST port of the popular monome app using JUCE. At this stage, the app is very much in the experimental phase, so probably code is quite possibly not in a working state! 

Current Status
--------------

UI is starting to take shape (at least in terms of functionality). Variable number of channels can be set at runtime.
Very basic audio processing can be done.


Possible Upcoming Features
-------------------------
- ADSR envelopes for samples (maybe make advanced options).
- configurable number of channels
- loop current block only on hold down button
- Also load MIDI tracks into strips
- Speed independent pitch control of samples
- 64 bit version?
- proper sample management
